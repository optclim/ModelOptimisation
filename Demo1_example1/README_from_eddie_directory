Shell scripts needed on eddie. eddie is a large cluster at the
University of Edinburgh.

Scripts below will need modification to run on other systems. Depends
on the job management system on the cluster...

postProcess.sh -- needed for an array of post processing jobs. Runs the post-processing  script to produce output.

qsub.sh -- run a job. Sets up std environment. Though -V arg in qsub should remove the need for that.
