# This file is a place holder for new sites to add appropriate resources for
# running the testing components for the AMIP climnate experiment.
#
# Only the compulsory families have been included, those that exist in the
# suite.rc file. Any other families required can also be added. See other
# site files for examples on how this can work.
#
# The best practise would be to make a copy of this file (or a more
# appropriately matched example) with a name for the computer that is being
# used. This should then also be added to the list of acceptable values in the
# jinja2 variable SITE in meta/rose-meta.conf.
#
# In order to get this site added to the master suite (u-az257), please take a
# branch copy of this suite, e.g.
#
# rosie checkout u-az257
# cd $HOME/roses/u-az257
# fcm bc -s <branch_name>
#
# This will leave you in a branch of the original suite. Once you have made
# the changes described above, commit them and email the suite owner
# (currently paul.earnshaw@metoffice.gov.uk) to get the changes merged onto
# the trunk of the suite.
#
# Thank you,
# Paul Earnshaw
